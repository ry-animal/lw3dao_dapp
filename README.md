# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

## quick solidity contract deployed on Goerli for setting a mood
 - use `npm -g i lite-server` for html server
 - use .env for `QUICKNODE_HTTP_URL` and `PRIVATE_KEY`
